# Redirector-scripts

The original redirector was made up of shell scripts and perl (https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/12/10/testing-the-redirections/).

The project has now completely changed to a much more modern ruby app, and has even changed name: https://github.com/alphagov/transition-config/. However, way back in the commit history is the old redirector scripts, and I find I often refer to them to remember how we did something in shell; so committing them here for ease of reference.

To see them on GitHub in their original location: https://github.com/alphagov/transition-config/tree/7bee2d60f
